### DRW Project
Moses Rahnama

This project looks at air traffic data during COVID-19 and the impact on Jet Fuel cracks, timespreads, and Gasoil/Jet Fuel spreads.

Sources of data.
1) OpenSkyNetwork for detailed air trafic data https://opensky-network.org/. This is the link for the REST API doc https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html. Their Python API has very limited use.
2) EnergyAspects (EA) for historical data, and balances forecast. EA is exceptionally strong in the oil and products marlets, and particluarly Jet Fuel, and their estimates are usually not far off from consensus.
3) The EIA for supply and demand data.
4) Bloomberg for historical prices.
5) NYTimes and Johns Hopkins Uni for COVID-19 stats.
