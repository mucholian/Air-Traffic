### Air Traffic and Jet Fuel Demand
Moses Rahnama

This project looks at air traffic data during COVID-19 and the impact on Jet Fuel cracks, timespreads, and Gasoil/Jet Fuel spreads.
While it is incredibly challenging to predict and model how COVID-19 will progress, I have built a model using historical numbers and future curve forecasts (third party) that predicts flight traffic.

This is a fully automated platform and within the next week or two, I expect to have completed a live platform for real time trade signals for the derivatives included in this project.

### Data Sources
1) OpenSkyNetwork for detailed air trafic data https://opensky-network.org/. This is the link for the REST API doc https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html. Their Python API has very limited use.
2) EnergyAspects (EA) for historical data, and balances forecast. EA is exceptionally strong in the oil and products markets, particluarly Jet Fuel, and their estimates oftem forms consensus.
3) The EIA for supply and demand data.
4) Bloomberg for historical prices.
5) NYTimes and Johns Hopkins University for COVID-19 stats.
